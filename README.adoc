= Effective Testing &amp; Test Automation

Some projects for my presentations on effective enterprise testing.

The example projects contain a _coffee-shop_ application, which uses the _coffee-shop-db_ database, and a _barista_ backend application.


== Running

You run the environment, containing the _coffee-shop_, _barista_ applications and the _coffee-shop-db_ using Docker containers.

In order to run the Docker containers locally, you need to create a Docker network first: + 
`docker network create --subnet=192.168.42.0/24 dkrnet`

Then you can build the _coffee-shop_ project and run the environment as follows:

[source,bash]
----
./local-build.sh
./local-run-env.sh
----

You can access the _coffee-shop_ application using HTTP, after the applications have been started:

[source,bash]
----
curl localhost:8001/coffee-shop/
curl localhost:8001/coffee-shop/orders
----

You create new coffee orders by POST-ing the JSON representation of a new order:

[source,bash]
----
curl localhost:8001/coffee-shop/orders -i \
  -XPOST \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"type":"Espresso","origin":"Colombia"}'
----

INFO: To stop and clean up the containers again, run: `docker stop coffee-shop barista coffee-shop-db`


== Running the tests

You run the non-integration tests by executing `mvn verify`, or `mvn package` (any goal that executes Maven's `test` phase):

----
cd coffee-shop/
mvn verify
----

You run the system integration tests (smoke tests) from the same directory.
The application needs to be deployed locally (`local-run-env.sh`):

----
# if not already running
../local-run-env.sh
mvn test-compile failsafe:integration-test failsafe:verify
----

You can run the systems tests either in a Kubernetes environment or using plain Docker containers.


=== System tests on local Docker containers

You run the system test environment by executing `systemtest-run-env.sh` in the root directory:

[source,bash]
----
./systemtest-run-env.sh
----

This starts up the _coffee-shop_ application, the _coffee-shop-db_ database, and a _barista_ mock server (WireMock).

The system tests contained in `coffee-shop-st/` will run against that deployed environment:

[source,bash]
----
cd coffee-shop-st/
mvn verify
----

INFO: To stop and clean up the system test containers again, run: `docker stop coffee-shop barista coffee-shop-db`
